    <img src="date-night-two-chocolate-fudge-cakes.jpg" width="300" height="400">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These individually portioned chocolate fudge cakes are intensely rich with a molten chocolate center, perfect for date night or a small-batch treat for two. Made in 30 minutes using ramekins, they combine the fudginess of ganache with cake-like edges, featuring semi-sweet chocolate melted with heavy cream. Serve warm, optionally topped with ice cream, whipped cream, or fresh berries for an indulgent dessert.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 ounces (85g) semi-sweet chocolate (¾ of a standard baking chocolate bar)</li>
        <li>¼ cup (60ml) heavy cream</li>
        <li>3 Tablespoons (36g) packed light brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons (30ml) vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons (30ml) beaten egg (crack 1 egg, beat it, and use 2 Tbsp)</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>6 Tablespoons (46g) all-purpose flour (spooned & leveled)</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon baking soda</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Lightly grease two 6-ounce ramekins with butter or nonstick spray. Place on a baking sheet. Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C).</li>
        <li>Coarsely chop 2 ounces (57g) of semi-sweet chocolate; reserve 1 ounce (28g) unchopped. Melt chopped chocolate with heavy cream in microwave (20-second increments, stirring) or double boiler until smooth. Whisk in brown sugar until dissolved.</li>
        <li>Whisk in oil, 2 Tablespoons beaten egg, and vanilla extract.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, whisk flour, baking powder, and baking soda. Fold dry ingredients into wet until no lumps remain. Divide batter evenly into ramekins (about ¾ full).</li>
        <li>Cut remaining 1 ounce chocolate in half; press one 0.5oz piece into center of each batter-filled ramekin, submerging fully with a spoon.</li>
        <li>Bake 15–17 minutes on lined baking sheet, rotating halfway. Centers remain gooey with melted chocolate. Serve immediately warm.</li>
