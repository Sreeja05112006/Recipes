Odin Recipes Project
Overview
This repository contains my solution to the Recipes project from 
The Odin Project's Foundations course.
It's a simple multi-page website built entirely with HTML, showcasing basic web development skills.
​
The site features a homepage linking to individual recipe pages for popular dishes, each with structured content including images, descriptions, ingredients, and cooking steps.

Recipe Pages:
H1 heading with dish name.
Free image of the finished dish.
"Description" section with 1-2 paragraphs.
"Ingredients" unordered list (<ul>).
"Steps" ordered list (<ol>).​

Recipes Included
